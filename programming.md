# Software, Product, and Embedded Engineering Candidates

In the programming language of your choice, write a program generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing
- "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
- "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
- "FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.
- "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
- the value F(n) otherwise.

We encourage you to compose your code for this question in a way that represents the quality of code you produce in the workplace - e.g. tests, documentation, linting, dependency management (though there's no need to go [this far](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/)).

Please upload your code to GitHub or bitbucket and post a link to the repo or gist as your answer in the Lever form.
