> Hi Swift Navigation Recruiting Team,
> I am Hanxiao Deng, currently a graduate student at UC Berkeley. I am very interested in what you're doing. My undergraduate major is Satellite Navigation, so I think I am perfectly suitable to your job opportunity. I finish all three question sets for Software Engineer in Software.java, Estimation Engineer in Estimation.pdf and GNSS Engineer in GNSS.pdf. All of the questions are really interesting and instructive. I hope I can get an opportunity to talk with you for jop opportunity. Lastly, I am planning to pursue a PhD degree next year, so I really want a internship position 2018 summer. I am at Berkeley now so that I can engage into your work as soon as possible. Looking forward to talking with you.
Best,
Hanxiao Deng
